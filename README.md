After the first attempt, I decided to increase the complexity of the product. One very good 3d artist, my friend, made a model of a revolver. The idea was to make a safe analogue of "Russian Roulette" game, similar to the simulation of a revolver from the times of the First World War, and try to make it with perfect graphics. it turned out well, in the end, it was done well. It was look like great for my 2015, but because of magic 8 was some bans, account was blocked and project died. There was still no desire and energy to publish somewhere and the project went to backup.
